# Ecommerce Data Analysis and Churn Prediction
📊 **A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Customer Behavior**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
In today’s competitive e-commerce landscape, retaining customers is just as important as acquiring new ones. **Customer churn**, or when customers stop engaging with a platform, is a significant challenge for businesses. This project aims to analyze e-commerce data to predict which customers are likely to churn and provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

This project takes you through a step-by-step journey:  
- From cleaning raw data to building machine learning models.  
- Highlighting business insights that can make a difference.

## 📊 Dataset Details
We use a Kaggle-based **e-commerce dataset** that contains information such as:  
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, Tenure (time on platform).  
- **Transaction Data**: Monthly spend, total spend, and engagement score.  
- **Churn Indicator**: Whether a customer stopped purchasing.  

> **Note:** Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset cannot be directly included here. Follow the instructions in the `data/` folder to download it.

## 🛠️ Project Steps
This project is broken down into five key stages, each designed to address a specific aspect of the analysis. Each step is structured as follows: **Why this step matters**, **What we’ll do**, and **How you can try it**.

---

### **Step 1: Data Cleaning**
**Why this step matters:**  
Raw data is often messy—missing values, incorrect data types, duplicates, etc. Cleaning the data ensures we’re working with accurate, usable information.

**What we’ll do:**  
1. Load the dataset and inspect its structure.  
2. Handle missing values using logical methods like imputation.  
3. Convert data types to ensure numerical and categorical data are processed correctly.  
4. Remove duplicates to avoid biased analysis.

**How you can try this:**  
Run the first notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_cleaning.ipynb
```

---

### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Why this step matters:**  
This is where we get to know our dataset. By visualizing patterns, we uncover trends that are not immediately obvious from the raw data.

**What we’ll explore:**  
- **Who are our customers?** Analyzing age, tenure, and demographics.  
- **What are their spending habits?** Visualizing monthly and total spend.  
- **What drives churn?** Identifying patterns that separate churned customers from retained ones.

**How you can try this:**  
Run the EDA notebook to generate insightful visualizations:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_eda.ipynb
```

---

### **Step 3: Feature Engineering**
**Why this step matters:**  
Raw data often needs transformation to extract meaningful insights. In this step, we’ll create new features that make our analysis more robust.

**What we’ll do:**  
1. Create a **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** metric.  
   - Formula: Monthly Spend × Subscription Tenure  
2. Build a **Recency Score**: Time since the last purchase.  
3. Categorize customers into **Engagement Levels**: High, Medium, Low.

**How you can try this:**  
Run the feature engineering notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/03_feature_engineering.ipynb
```

---

### **Step 4: Model Training**
**Why this step matters:**  
Here, we use machine learning to predict churn. By understanding which factors are most important, businesses can intervene before customers leave.

**What we’ll do:**  
1. Split the data into **training and testing sets** to evaluate model performance.  
2. Train machine learning models, such as:  
   - Logistic Regression (simple, interpretable).  
   - Random Forest (handles complex data well).  
3. Evaluate model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.  

**How you can try this:**  
Run the model training notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/04_model_training.ipynb
```

---

### **Step 5: Results and Insights**
**Why this step matters:**  
Numbers alone don’t tell a story. This step focuses on interpreting the results and translating them into actionable business strategies.

**What we’ll do:**  
1. Highlight key findings, such as:  
   - Customers with low engagement scores have the highest churn risk.  
   - Churn is most likely during the first 6-12 months of tenure.  
2. Provide recommendations to reduce churn, e.g., targeted discounts for at-risk customers.  
3. Share visualizations and insights through clear graphs and reports.

**How you can try this:**  
Run the final notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/05_results_analysis.ipynb
```
