## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn (when customers stop buying) is a major challenge in e-commerce. In this project, we explore real transaction data to understand what drives churn and how businesses can **predict and prevent customer loss**. 

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source:** A Kaggle-based e-commerce dataset.
- **Key Features:**
  - Customer demographics (Age, Tenure)
  - Purchase behavior (Total Spend, Monthly Spend, Engagement Score)
  - Churn indicator (Whether the customer stopped buying)

## 🏆 Key Insights
- **Engagement is everything:** Customers with a low engagement score are more likely to churn.
- **The first few months are critical:** Most churn happens within the first 12 months of subscription.
- **Price sensitivity exists:** Higher-spending customers are at risk if engagement drops.
