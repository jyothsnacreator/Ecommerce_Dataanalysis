# Ecommerce Data Analysis and Churn Prediction
📊 **A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Customer Behavior**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
In today’s competitive e-commerce landscape, retaining customers is just as important as acquiring new ones. **Customer churn**, or when customers stop engaging with a platform, is a significant challenge for businesses. This project aims to analyze e-commerce data to predict which customers are likely to churn and provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

This project takes you through a step-by-step journey:  
- From cleaning raw data to building machine learning models.  
- Highlighting business insights that can make a difference.

## 📊 Dataset Details
We use a Kaggle-based **e-commerce dataset** that contains information such as:  
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, Tenure (time on platform).  
- **Transaction Data**: Monthly spend, total spend, and engagement score.  
- **Churn Indicator**: Whether a customer stopped purchasing.  

> Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset cannot be directly included here. Instructions to download and set it up are provided below.

## 🛠️ Project Steps
This project is broken down into five key stages, each designed to address a specific aspect of the analysis. Each step is explained naturally, as if we’re walking you through the process together.

### **Step 1: Data Cleaning**
**Why this step matters:**  
Raw data is often messy—missing values, incorrect data types, duplicates, etc. Cleaning the data ensures we’re working with accurate, usable information.

**What we’ll do:**  
1. Load the dataset and inspect its structure.  
2. Handle missing values using logical methods like imputation.  
3. Convert data types to ensure numerical and categorical data are processed correctly.  
4. Remove duplicates to avoid biased analysis.
